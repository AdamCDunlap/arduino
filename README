These are all of my files I wrote for arduino. Some are for 0022, some are for
1.0. I've tried to keep the files for 0022 with the .pde extension and the ones
for 1.0 with the .ino extension, but mistakes are made.

Some of the libraries here are written by other people are are quite possibly
copyrighted. However, nothing in here was bought.

Some files have the .vi extensions; these are files for a language called
LabVIEW.
