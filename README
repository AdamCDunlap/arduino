These are all of my arduino programs.

I use GNU make rather than the arduino IDE; however, most files should be
compatible with both. The main Makefile I use can be found here:

sysoptions.mk will likely have to be reconfigured for each person depending on
how their filesystems are set up, and Makefile in the root directory is just
for easy copying.
