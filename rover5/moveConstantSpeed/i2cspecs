Jobs of interface arduino:
Run motors
Read encoders

i2c address: 12

When a master requests data, the interface arduino will send back the encoder
 values for each of the encoders in order: 1, 2, 3, then 4. Each value will
 be two bytes LSB first, and there will be 8 bytes total
When a master sends data, it must send a full 8 bytes, representing 4 integers
 LSB first. Each integer must be -255 to 255 and correspond to the powers
 of each of the four motors in order: 1, 2, 3, then 4.
